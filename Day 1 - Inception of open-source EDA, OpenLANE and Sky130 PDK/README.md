# 🧠 Sky130 Day 1 – Inception of Open-Source EDA, OpenLANE, and Sky130 PDK


## **Overview**

The **Sky130 open-source PDK** and **OpenLANE ASIC design flow** have revolutionized modern chip design by eliminating dependence on closed, expensive EDA tools.
This framework enables students, researchers, and startups to design, simulate, and tape-out silicon chips using open-source software and a free PDK provided by SkyWater Technology Foundry.

The **Sky130 process node** (130 nm CMOS) may be legacy, but it remains widely used for its cost-effectiveness, tool maturity, and suitability for education and prototyping.

## **1. How to Talk to Computers**

### **1.1 Introduction to QFN-48 Package, Chip, Pads, Core, Die, and IPs**

* The **QFN-48** (Quad Flat No-lead, 48 pins) package is a compact surface-mount standard that allows efficient chip integration onto printed circuit boards (PCBs).
* The **chip architecture** includes:

  * **Die core** – contains the actual silicon logic circuits.
  * **Pads** – act as interfaces between internal signals and external package pins.
  * **Package pins** – provide mechanical and electrical connection to the PCB.
* The **System-on-Chip (SoC)** integrates multiple **IP blocks** such as memory, processors, and I/O controllers within a single die.
* Proper **pad arrangement**, **bonding wire routing**, and **substrate design** ensure minimal signal interference, reduced noise, and enhanced device reliability.

### **1.2 Introduction to RISC-V**

* **RISC-V** is an open and modular **Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)** that provides flexibility and extensibility for SoC development.
* Its simplicity allows designers to create **custom CPUs** or **hardware accelerators** that meet specific performance or power needs.
* RISC-V supports a clean separation between:

  * **Base instructions** (integer operations)
  * **Optional extensions** (floating-point, atomic, vector, etc.)
* Its open nature aligns perfectly with open-source ASIC design using OpenLANE and Sky130 PDK.

---

### **1.3 From Software Applications to Hardware**

* Software algorithms are mapped into **hardware logic** using **Hardware Description Languages (HDLs)** like **Verilog** or **VHDL**.
* These describe how data moves through:

  * **Data paths** – performing operations such as addition, multiplication, shifting.
  * **Control paths** – orchestrating operations via state machines and timing.
* The **OpenLANE flow** translates the RTL (Register-Transfer Level) design into a **physical layout** (GDSII), ready for fabrication.
* This involves clocking, synchronization, timing constraints, and physical placement rules.

### 💡 **Process Design Kit (PDK) Explanation**

* The **PDK** defines all the physical and electrical characteristics of the semiconductor manufacturing process.
* Key PDK files include:

  * **LEF** (Library Exchange Format): Describes cell geometries for placement and routing.
  * **LIB** (Timing Library): Provides timing, area, and power data for synthesis and STA.
  * **SPICE Models:** Device electrical characteristics for simulation.
  * **GDSII Files:** Final layout representation for fabrication.

### **2.2 Simplified RTL2GDS Flow**

The **RTL-to-GDSII** process converts digital logic (RTL) into a physical chip layout.
OpenLANE automates this process through several major stages:

#### **a) Synthesis**

* Converts RTL into a **gate-level netlist** using standard cells from the library.
* Optimizes timing, area, and power based on technology constraints.

#### **b) Floor and Power Planning**

* Defines chip dimensions, placement boundaries, and **power distribution networks (PDN)**.
* Adds **power rings** and **decoupling capacitors** to stabilize voltage and prevent latch-up.
* Positions macros and I/O cells to maintain signal integrity.

#### **c) Placement**

* Performs **global** and **detailed placement** to distribute cells evenly.
* Ensures minimal routing congestion and optimal timing.

#### **d) Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS)**

* Builds a balanced **clock distribution network** using buffers, H-trees, or mesh structures.
* Reduces **clock skew** and maintains synchronous operation.

#### **e) Routing**

* Connects logic gates and macros using multiple **metal layers** (odd layers → horizontal, even → vertical).
* Controls **signal integrity**, **cross-talk**, and **via density**.

#### **f) Sign-Off**

* **Physical Verification:** DRC (Design Rule Check) and LVS (Layout vs Schematic).
* **Timing Verification:** STA (Static Timing Analysis) ensures timing closure.
* Confirms the design meets all fabrication constraints.

### **2.4 Introduction to OpenLANE Detailed ASIC Design Flow**

This section provides a comprehensive overview of the **OpenLANE** end-to-end ASIC design flow — from Register Transfer Level (RTL) description to the final **GDSII** layout ready for fabrication. OpenLANE integrates multiple open-source EDA tools, automating complex stages while maintaining flexibility for user control and optimization.

#### **Synthesis**

* The design’s **RTL code** (typically written in Verilog) is synthesized using **Yosys**.
* Yosys converts high-level behavioral logic into a **gate-level netlist**, mapped to standard cells from the **Sky130 PDK**.
* The synthesized netlist undergoes **logic optimization** for area, timing, and power efficiency.

#### **Floorplanning**

* Defines the **die area**, **core boundaries**, **I/O pin placements**, and **power distribution network (PDN)**.
* Macro placement and routing blockages are defined to ensure sufficient routing space.
* Power rails and metal layers are arranged systematically to minimize **IR drop** and **electromigration** issues.

#### **Placement**

* Placement is performed in two stages: **global placement** and **detailed placement**.
* Standard cells are optimally arranged to reduce wirelength, congestion, and delay.
* The design ensures timing-critical paths have minimal interconnect delay while maintaining design-rule compliance.

#### **Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS)**

* The **CTS** process distributes the clock signal uniformly to all sequential elements.
* Clock buffers and inverters are inserted to reduce **skew** and **latency** across the design.
* Balanced clock networks, such as **H-tree** or **X-tree**, are commonly implemented for uniform timing propagation.

#### **Routing**

* The routing stage establishes **metal interconnections** between placed cells.
* Global routing plans the overall topology, while **detailed routing** finalizes the physical connections.
* OpenROAD’s **TritonRoute** ensures all nets are connected, adhering to **design rules** for wire spacing, width, and via density.
* Multi-layer routing (with alternate horizontal and vertical metal layers) enhances signal integrity and minimizes crosstalk.

#### **Sign-Off and Physical Verification**

* **Design Rule Check (DRC)** ensures compliance with all foundry-defined geometric and spacing constraints.
* **Layout Versus Schematic (LVS)** verifies that the final layout matches the original logical netlist.
* **Static Timing Analysis (STA)** checks timing closure, ensuring all setup and hold constraints are met at the defined clock frequency.
* Additional checks like **antenna rule verification** and **parasitic extraction** are also performed.

#### **GDSII Export**

* After successful verification, the finalized layout is exported as a **GDSII** file — the standard format for chip fabrication.
* The GDSII file includes all physical layer information (diffusion, polysilicon, metals, vias, etc.) required by the foundry.

#### **Key Advantages**

* Fully automated and repeatable flow, ensuring **reproducibility** and **scalability**.
* Enables rapid **design iterations**, optimization, and exploration of trade-offs (area vs. timing vs. power).
* Makes **ASIC design accessible** to students, researchers, and startups without access to costly proprietary EDA tools.
